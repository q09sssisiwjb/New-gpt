# Overview

This is an AI chat assistant application built with Next.js 15 and the assistant-ui library. The application provides a conversational interface with multiple AI models, featuring a thread-based chat system with model selection capabilities. Users can interact with various free AI models through OpenRouter, with support for markdown rendering, code syntax highlighting, and file attachments.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and React Server Components (RSC)
- Uses the modern Next.js App Router architecture with TypeScript
- Implements client-side state management with Zustand for chat runtime
- Turbopack enabled for faster development builds

**UI Component System**: 
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- Shadcn/ui component library with "new-york" style preset
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with custom design tokens
- Framer Motion for animations and transitions

**Chat Interface Architecture**:
- **assistant-ui**: Core chat functionality with React hooks and primitives
- **Thread-based conversations**: Multiple conversation threads with persistence
- **Automatic title generation**: AI-powered auto-titling from first user message (like ChatGPT)
- **Model switching**: Dynamic model selection from free OpenRouter models
- **Custom API Keys**: Users can bring their own OpenRouter keys for unlimited access
- **Markdown rendering**: Full markdown support with syntax highlighting via react-shiki
- **Attachment support**: File upload and display capabilities
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first with collapsible sidebar navigation

## Backend Architecture

**API Layer**:
- Next.js API Routes (App Router convention)
- `/api/chat` endpoint handles all chat interactions with streaming responses
- `/api/generate-title` endpoint generates concise chat titles using AI
- `/api/models` endpoint provides available model list

**AI Integration**:
- Primary provider: OpenRouter via `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
- Vercel AI SDK for model abstraction and streaming
- Support for multiple free AI models (DeepSeek, Llama, Venice, etc.)
- Model configuration stored in `/lib/free-models.ts`

**Authentication & Data Persistence**:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Email/password and Google OAuth sign-in
- **User Context**: React Context API (`AuthContext`) for auth state management
- **Firestore Database**: Chat history and thread storage per user
- **Chat History Service**: CRUD operations in `/lib/chatHistory.ts`
- **User Profile**: Display in sidebar with avatar and sign out capability
- **Title Storage**: localStorage-based persistence in `/lib/titleStorage.ts` (works without authentication)
- **Custom API Key Storage**: localStorage-based storage in `/lib/customApiKey.ts` (browser-only, secure)
- **Custom Event System**: 'chat-title-updated' and 'customApiKeyUpdated' events for reactive UI updates across components

**State Management**:
- Client-side: Zustand for runtime state
- Chat runtime: `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk` with `useChatRuntime` hook
- Thread management: Built into assistant-ui primitives
- Auth state: Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener
